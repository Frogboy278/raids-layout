# Raids Layout + Combat Room Solver

This is an extension to the raids layout solver created by Woox - the original can be found here https://wooxsolo.github.io/raids-layout/index.html. This extension lets users enter which exact combat rooms they can see and will attempt to solve hidden combat rooms using the 2 known "combat room wheel" patterns.

Forked from: https://github.com/WooxSolo/raids-layout

# How to use

Each box represents a possible position for a room. Click on a box to select it, then click on the corresponding button above to set the room. Once you've entered enough information, the rest of the boxes will be automatically filled out with the solved rooms.

Once the raid has been solved, a list of possible combat room orders is also generated below. Unknown combat and puzzle rooms will be displayed as "Combat" or "Puzzle". Identifying all visible combat rooms using the boxes above will narrow down the list of possibilities.
