# Raids Layout + Combat Room Solver

This is an extension to the raids layout solver created by Woox - the original can be found here https://wooxsolo.github.io/raids-layout/index.html. This extension lets users enter which exact combat rooms they can see and will attempt to solve hidden combat rooms using the 2 known "combat room wheel" patterns.
