# raids-layout
A webpage that predicts the layout of your Oldschool Runescape raids

I've not spent much effort on this project as I didn't intend to make it public. However due to popular request, I've decided to put it here on GitHub for others to use. It doesn't have any fancy graphics, but it should be good enough to be useful.

How it works: Select any of the boxes by clicking on them and set the type of the room by clicking the buttons. You can connect rooms by right clicking other rooms, or unconnenct them by right clicking the selected room. There are only 26 different layouts that you can get of a raid, and the website will use the information you've put in to figure out exactly which one you've gotten.
Each letter represents a different room, here's what they mean:
\# Start of floor
Â¤ End of floor
C Combat room (Muttadiles, Vanguards, Vespula, Vasa, Tekton, Shamans, Mystics or Guardians)
P Puzzle room (Tightrope, Ice demon, Chests or Crabs)
F Farming room
S Scavenger room
